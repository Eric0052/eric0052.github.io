`BioCell-1K` distills expert microscopy annotations into a unified, privacy-preserving dataset paired with multi-modal foundation checkpoints.

## What We Built

- 1,024 curated Petri dish sequences with dual-modality labels
- Pretraining recipe that fuses visual tokens with symbolic lab logs
- Lightweight evaluation board for predicting treatment response

## Collaboration

Co-developed with BioLab (NIH) and MIT Media Lab; currently onboarding clinical partners.
