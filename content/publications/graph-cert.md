# Summary

We propose a curriculum-driven certification pipeline for graph neural networks (GNNs) that adapts certificates to the structural statistics of each input component. The method yields **32% tighter robustness guarantees** on OpenGraphBench.

## Highlights

- Layerwise randomized smoothing tailored for variable-size neighborhoods
- Differentiable relaxation that keeps certificate gradients stable
- Public release of the `graph-cert-kit` benchmark harness
