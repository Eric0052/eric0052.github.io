# Abstract

We embed Hamiltonian priors into diffusion guidance for particle interactions. The resulting sampler accelerates collider-grade simulations by **14×** while preserving physical invariants.

## Key Contributions

1. Hybrid score function that jointly reasons about energy and momentum constraints
2. Hierarchical alignment loss for calibrating simulators with sparse sensors
3. Open-source dataset of 1.2M trajectories (CC-BY)
