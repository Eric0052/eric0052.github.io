# Building a Minimal Academic Homepage

I've been iterating on a personal template that keeps **Markdown as the source of truth** for everything—papers, projects, and quick notes like this.

## Why static?

- Zero backend maintenance
- Works on GitHub Pages in minutes
- Easy to diff + review

## What's next?

I plan to add:

1. RSS feed powered by a small build step
2. Inline citation badges
3. Micro-interactions triggered from scroll position
